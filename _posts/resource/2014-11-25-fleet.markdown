####Clarksons Fleet Register
The World Fleet Register is an online data service, comprising details of all merchant vessels over 100 GT. It covers more than 80,000 vessels in service, on order, under conversion or recently removed from the fleet, any of which may be selected by a wide range of criteria. 
ACCESS PROCEDURES: This database uses the librarian's email address (ch_at_wmu_DOT_se) as the account name for logging in. The password is: ***BR9GABK*** . 

You must still access from on campus or through the university proxy server (that uses your WMU email log in). When accessing electronic reports, you will have to confirm that you are the librarian.  Please just confirm. By contract all WMU students and staff are entitled to access. This just a quirk in Clarkson's authentication system and you will not be violating access privileges. 

***USE OF THIS DATABASE IS FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES ONLY. COMMERCIAL USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.***
