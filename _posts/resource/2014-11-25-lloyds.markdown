####Lloyd's List 
Access the oldest running periodical in the maritime sector for the latest news and back issues. WMU has an institutional subscription. Students, faculty and staff can create a personal account, which they can use to log on to LLoyd's online from anywhere. 
To create your account, you must be on campus -- the main building or HSR.
* Go to the login page.
* Next to the login form is a text box which acknowledges your membership in a corporate account. Follow the link in that text box "Click here to set up a new account."
* Your account must have your WMU.SE email address.

Once you have created it, you may log on to LLoyd's from anywhere and get the full content to the Lloyd's daily, the archive database and Containerisation International.
